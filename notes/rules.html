<h1>Simon's Rules</h1>

<p>
Twenty handy life tips for how not to be an arse and look after yourself. A mix of practicality, philosophy and common sense,
inspired by Gibbs' Rules (NCIS), Baz Luhrman's Sunscreen and years of imparting sagely advice to cadets, amoung other things.
</p>
		  
<h2>1. Don’t get caught</h2>
<p>This applies to the little things that are against the rules (walking on the grass, etc),
not things that are against the law (like murder) or morally wrong (like bullying).</p>

<h2>2. Man up</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Don't moan about first-world problems.</li>
	<li>A little discomfort won't kill you.</li>
	<li>If you get caught, don't make excuses. You're busted, accept the consequences.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Don’t ask, don’t get</h2>
<p>Whether it's seconds at dinner, a date with the girl or a payrise.
The worst that will happen is someone will say no, in which case you'll be no
worse off that you were to start with.</p>

<h2>4. Better to seek forgiveness than ask permission</h2>
<p>This isn't about abusing situations, but about knowing when to push the boundaries.
There's an overwhelming number of people in life who are naysayers and sometimes you gotta just roll the dice and say WTF.</p>

<h2>5. Clean up your own mess</h2>
<dl>
	<dt>Literally</dt><dd>Look after your environment (not just "the environment"), e.g. your house, your room, your office, your desk, places you stay, etc.</dd>
	<dt>Metaphorically</dt><dd>If you fuck up, acknowledge it, fix it - whatever you need to do.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>6. Honour, Integrity, Generosity, Respect</h2>
<dl>
	<dt>Honour</dt><dd> <q>&ldquo;Mine honor is my life, both grow in one. Take honor from me, and my life is done.&rdquo;<br />&mdash; Richard II, William Shakespeare</q></dd>
	<dt>Integrity</dt><dd>Never cheat &mdash; not on exams, the crossword puzzle or your significant other.</dd>
	<dt>Generosity</dt><dd>Be generous with your time, money and knowledge. Give charitably, generously and anonymously.</dd>
	<dt>Respect</dt><dd>For yourself and for others. Remember, respect is earned.</dd>
</dl>
	
<h2>7. Love thy self</h2>
<p>Don’t seek the approval of others. Validate yourself.
Don’t seek compliments. Don’t do things because you think other people will like you more. Do things that make you happy.
Be confident in the person you are and know that if you like yourself, others do too. This is not an excuse to be vain or self-obsessed.
</p>

<h2>8. Actions speak louder than words</h2>
<p>Talking is easy, it's the doing that's hard.</p>

<h2>9. Maintain good manners in all things</h2>
<p>Mind your Ps and Qs, hold open doors, give up your seat on the train/bus, and all that other good stuff.</p>

<h2>10. Walk with purpose</h2>
<p>Don't slouch - head up, eyes forward. Pick your feet up. Brisk pace, no dawdling.</p>

<h2>11. Look out for the little guy</h2>
<p>Protect the innocent, defend the weak. Women and children first.</p>

<h2>12. Keep calm and carry on</h2>
<blockquote>
If you can keep your head when all about you<br />
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;<br />
&hellip;<br/ >
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,<br />
And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!<br />
<small><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If%E2%80%94">If&mdash;</a>, Rudyard Kipling</small>
</blockquote>

<h2>13. Work to live, don't live to work</h2>
<p>Do something you love, but either way you should not confuse your career with your life.</p>

<h2>14. Buy experiences instead of things</h2>
<blockquote>
Things get old. Things become ordinary. Things stay the same. Things wear out. Things are difficult to share.
But experiences are totally unique; they shine like diamonds in your memory, often more brightly every year, and they can be shared forever.<br />
<small>&mdash; <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/buying-happiness.html">Buying Happiness</a>, Jeff Atwood</small>
</blockquote>

<h2>15. Never lend money unless you're prepared to write it off</h2>
<p>Which do you value more, your friendship or the couple of hundred quid you lent?</p>

<h2>16. Call it like it is</h2>
<p>If someone's being a dick, tell them. If someone's spouting crap, speak up, call bullshit.</p>

<h2>17. There's no privacy on the internet</h2>
<p>When posing for any photos, assume that the only people who will see them are your parents, your boss, and the dean of admissions.
Likewise, assume anything you put on the internet (especially Facebook) will stay there, forever, and be visible to everyone.</p>

<h2>18. Sugar is toxic</h2>
<p>Seriously, <a href="http://www.uctv.tv/skinny-on-obesity/" title="The Skinny on Obesity">it is</a>.
Look after your body, it's the only one you'll get. Exercise regularly, don't eat shit (processed foods, etc).</p>

<h2>19. Don't believe what you're told. Double check.</h2>
<p>Just because you aren’t full of crap, doesn’t mean other people aren’t. People often interpret and hear things incorrectly.
I’m not saying don’t believe people, but definitely take the time to find things out for yourself too.</p>

<h2>20. Sometimes, you're wrong &mdash; apologise</h2>
<p>Nobody is perfect and everyone makes mistakes from time to time. When you do, remember to apply rules 2 and 5.
Apologises should not be to merely appease someone, they should be sincere and not half-assed.</p>
